# Notes:
# - Mark things SAFE if they're kid-friendly
# - Mark things BAD if they contain inappropriate language, personal info, or unsafe content
# - Even censored swear words (with numbers/symbols) should be marked BAD in ANY context
# - Pyx learns from these examples to filter content automatically
#

# ❌ Self-harm/suicidal content = BAD (e.g., "I want to kill myself", "I want to die")
# ❌ Racist/discriminatory language = ALWAYS BAD (even if censored)
# ❌ Profanity = ALWAYS BAD (even in positive contexts like compliments)
# ✅ Fake/placeholder info = SAFE (e.g., "blank", "example", "555-1234")
